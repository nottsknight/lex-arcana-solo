Here are some of the important figures encountered during the course
of Quartinius Dio's journeys. They are grouped according to where they
were encountered.

## Mettius Quartinius Dio

Mettius is an augur of the Cohors Auxilia Arcana. He comes from a patrician
family and his father owns a significant amount of land near the town of
Aquae Sulis in the province of Britannia. He was recruited into the Cohors
Arcana at the age of 19 when his affinity with the gods became apparent.
By his request he was posted to Britannia after his _tirocinium_---officially
because he claimed an interest in Celtic magic but actually so that he might
remain close to his family.

## Eboracum

### Egnatius Photius

Egnatius Photius is a military tribune based at the castrum outside Eboracum.
He is a serious man, confident of his own abilities, and generally slightly
skeptical of the mission of the Cohors Arcana. He tolerates Quartinius with
a little amusement.

### Urbicius Brigantum

Urbicius is a quaestor serving in Eboracum. His family are Gaelic from north of
the Vallum Hadriani and only recently gained Roman citizenship; he took the
cognomen Brigantum as a way of owning and celebrating his own ancestry.
He is generally impatient, but cares deeply about the condition of the
natives of the province.
