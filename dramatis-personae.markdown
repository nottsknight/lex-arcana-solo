Here are some of the important figures encountered during the course
of Quartinius Dio's journeys. They are grouped according to where they
were encountered.

## Metellus Quartinius Dio

Metellus is an augur of the Cohors Auxilia Arcana. He comes from a patrician
family and his father owns a significant amount of land near the town of
Aquae Sulis in the province of Britannia.

## Eboracum

### Egnatius Photius

Egnatius Photius is the military legate of the castrum outside Eboracum.
He is a serious man, confident of his own abilities, and generally slightly
skeptical of the mission of the Cohors Arcana. He tolerates Quartinius with
a little amusement.

### Urbicius Barbarus

Urbicius is a quaestor serving in Eboracum. His family are Pictish and only
gained Roman citizenship; he took the name Barbarus as a way of owning and
celebrating his own ancestry. He is generally impatient, but cares deeply
about the condition of the natives of the province.
