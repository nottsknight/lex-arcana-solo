HAE ACTA METTII QUARTINII DIONI SUMUS, CUSTOS ET AUGUR COHORTIS AUXILIA ARCANA.

This blog is the record of a solo-play campaign in the world of Lex Arcana,
an alternate-history version of the Roman Empire where the practice of divination
is real and powerful. Thanks to this magic the Empire never fell and continues
on in strength to this day.

### Roman names

Romans might have up to three names: the _praenomen_ used only by close friends
and family, the _nomen gentilicum_ which showed which _gens_ or clan they
descended from, and the _cognomen_ when helped distinguish people within a _gens_.
Most Romans are called by their _nomen_, with the other names only used when
necessary.

### Roman dates

Quartinius' journal entries give the date in the Roman manner. Roman dates were
counted relative to the three major days of the month: the _Kalends_ (transition from
one month to the next), the _Nones_ and the _Ides_. The first journal entry
is dated _a.d. V Non. Mar._ which stands for _ante diem quintum Nonas Martius_ or
_the 5th day before the Nones of March_.
