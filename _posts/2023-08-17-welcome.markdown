This is the journal of the custodian Mettius Quartinius Dio, a character in
the world of Lex Arcana. In this blog you'll find accounts of his adventures
in the alternate-history Roman Empire of that world, as well as details of
how the game was played out.

This is a record of my solo-play RPG campaign using the Lex Arcana
system combined with Inflatable Studios' One Page Solo Engine. Links to both
are below:
