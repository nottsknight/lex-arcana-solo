### a.d. V Nones Martius MCCXXIX [3rd March, AD 476]

Returning from the south having completed a mission to explain a sudden blight that
had afflicted several villas in the area of Deva. Two miles from the castrum
at Eboracum, came across a strange box seemingly abandoned at the side of the road.
It was metal, of a kind I had never seen before, and unmarked besides an inscription
that read, "I was made for Geminius and Flavia."
