### a.d. V Non. Mar. MCCXXIX [3rd March, AD 476]

The journey back from father's estate was mostly uneventful. The weather was
already turning mild and the long ride from Aquae Sulis was pleasant. It was mother
who suggested starting this journal; she seemed to assume that one day people
would naturally want to read about the exploits of a famous _custos_ of the Cohors Arcana.
I tried explaining to her that getting famous wasn't exactly the point of the Cohors,
but it didn't seem to make much difference.

I was only two miles from the castrum when I found the box. I was sheltering from a
sudden downpour in a small wood when I noticed it lying in the undergrowth. Half a
cubit square, made of a kind of metal I didn't recognise and with an inscription on
the top: "I was made for Geminius and Flavia." I was going to examine it further
but it was then that a voice called out from deeper in the trees, "We'll be having
that, friend." [_Scene complication: 1. Hostile forces oppose you_]

To their credit they were witty, offering to save me the burden of carrying my
possiessions through the downpour. "We'll keep them safe and dry," one said,
"you don't need to worry about that." As far as they were concerned I was just a lone
Roman out on a journey. I edged towards my horse who carried my hatchet among other
things, as I tried to pacify them. "_Pax_, gentlemen, I'm just on my way to
Eboracum and I don't need any trouble." [_De Societate DT 9, 1d6 result = 5_]

They didn't take me seriously and one slowly drew his knife as he approached casually.
"Come on sir, come away from the horse, you know how this'll go otherwise."
Unfortunately for him I'd got a hold of my axe and I swung at him, knocking his knife
aside before striking him hard across the jaw with the blunt side of the axe head
[_De Bello 9 vs. 7, 1d6 damage = 4_]. He staggered back and his compatriot let out
a growl of anger as he drew his own knife and came at me. I felled the first
man with a strong blow to his neck [_De Bello 10 vs. 6, 2d6 damage = 6_], but his
friend was able top take advantage and scored a long deep slash across my left arm
[_De Bello 7 vs. 5+7, 2d6 damage = 9_]. We drew back and I gestured to his fallen
friend. "It's not worth the fight, fellow. Take your friend and go." He looked at me
for a moment before heaving his friend over his shoulder and disappearing.

it was a very painful ride to cover the last two miles to the _castrum_, but thankfully
they'd seen me coming. I showed my ring to the officer on the gate and he immediately
sent for the camp _medicus_ who did his best to stitch me up. I decided I could
wait until morning to report to the tribune.

### a.d. IV Non. Mar. [4th March]

I woke still very sore, and presented myself to the camp tribune as early as I could.
Egnatius Photius was the legion's junior tribune, only here for a year to get some
experience before returning to the Senate, and he seemed to look at everyone with mild
amusement. That was certainly how he greeted me as I was shown into his room.

"I see even the vaunted _custodes_ must sometimes grapple with mundane problems!"
I smiled grimly at him. He didn't fully understand or respect the Cohors Arcana,
and I couldn't be bothered to correct him. As usual I got straight to business and placed
the box on his table.

"I just thought I'd ask if you recognised the names on this. I don't recognise what it's made
of, and it's sealed shut but sounds hollow." The tribune looked at it and shrugged.

"Doesn't mean anything to me. Is this really what you spend your time looking into?"

"For now. Something to look into while my arm heals." [_Complication: 6. Things actually
go as planned_]

Egnatius smirked and slid the box back to me. "Well we can't have one of the Emperor's
special few straining themselves too hard can we? I've never heard of these two, you
might as well speak to one of the magistrates in town."

I nodded and took the box back. "Thank you, tribune."

#### Dies idem

Eboracum was busy as always, the largest Roman settlement this far north and capital
of _Britannia Inferior_. After asking around I was directed to speak to one of the quaestors,
a man called Urbicius. He was busy overseeing the counting of some tax or other
and was very unimpressed by my interruption. I showed him the box.

He paused for a moment when he looked at it, and before he could say otherwise I asked him,
"Who are these two?" [_De Societate DT 6, 1d6 result = 6 (+3)_]. After a moment he answered,
"Friends of mine. Where did you find this?" I explained how I had come across the box.
Urbicius sighed.

"Geminius Musca is a friend of my brother. Invalided from the legions after he lost
a hand. He married Flavia three weeks ago. They were meant to be travelling to Deva
to visit a distant relative..."

"Any idea what this box is? It's sealed." The quaestor shook his head.

"Flavia is was a skilled metalworker, but I've never seen this before. The metal
looks familiar though..." He turned the box around in the light, and I noticed the dull
green sheen in the metal as it reflected the sun. "I know Geminius was talking
about some new material he'd got hold of for his wife."

I explained how I'd found the box and asked whether Urbicius had any idea how
this couple had planned to make the journey to Deva. He said he didn't, and at that
I left him to his work. I might have imagined it but he seemed slightly friendlier
towards me than before---perhaps news of his brother's friends had warmed him to me.
Regardless, I decided to do as I'd said to Egnatius: I'd track down this couple
and work out what this object was.
